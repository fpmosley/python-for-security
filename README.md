# Introduction to Python for Security

Welcome to the Introduction to Python for Security course!

## Course Description
This course is an introduction to the Python programming language. During this course, students will learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. Hundreds of thousands of cybersecurity professionals use Python every day to write code for scripting and the automation of security-related tools. Students will learn to set up a Python environment in Windows and Linux, advanced Python programming, and how to use external libraries. 

## Learning Objectives
* Execute nested loops in Python.
* Practice how to create a range with various inputs in a Python loop.
* Create a calculator in Python.
* Create a network client and server socket.
* Customize your PyCharm environment.
* Use Python to build a program that will print a string to the console.
* Create basic connectivity between the client and server sockets.
* Build a work environment and begin to acquire hands-on experience with Python.
* Write an ARP poisoning detector in Python to detect MiTM attacks.
* Resolve errors in Python code using “try” and “except” statements.

## Code
As we go through each module there will be demonstrations of the concepts being taught using Python code examples. This repo contains the code examples shown in class as well as code from the lab assignments.

The code for each module can be found in the branch for that module. For example, the branch `01-introduction-to-programming` contains all the code from module 1.
