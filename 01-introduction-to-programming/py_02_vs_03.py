# This is an example of differences between Python 2 and Python 3

# Difference in division
# Python 2 will round down and return an integer. This is called "integer division"
# Python 3 will return a float. This is called "float division"

print(5/2) 

# Use of parentheses
# Python 2 does not use parentheses in commands.
# Python 3 treats commands as functions.

print "Hello World"     # This only works in Python 2. Comment out for Python 3
print("Hello World")    # Python 3 treats print as a function.
